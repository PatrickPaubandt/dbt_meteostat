In the Northwind project, we merged the different company data sets so that we could make statements about sales performance and analyze monthly developments by product category. 

As a result, we created the mart_sales_performance table. This table shows revenues by year, month, and product category. Total orders and revenues per order can be evaluated. 

This table is particularly suitable for quickly analyzing the sales performance of the Northwind company.
